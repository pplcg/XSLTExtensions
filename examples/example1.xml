<paragraph id="para001">The Print and Page Layout Community Group is open to all aspects of page
layout theory and practice. We can and will cover everything from the
Crystal Goblet through to specifications and on to the nitty-gritty of
writing stylesheets. You will find XSL-FO discussed here, but you will
also find other stylesheet languages, and all are equally welcome.</paragraph>
