FOPRunXSLTExt

Produced by the Print and Page Layout Community Group at W3C.  See
http://www.w3.org/community/ppl/.

FOPRunXSLTExt is an (early) experiment in getting the area tree from
an XSL formatter run as the result of calling an XSLT extension
function in the same XSLT transform as will produce the "final" FO
tree to be output for formatting as human readable pages.

It was initially developed by Arved Sandstrom of MagicLamp Software
following discussion on the public-ppl@w3.org mailing list. Further
development now happens in the 'ppl' Mercurial repository at
https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ppl, with questions and comments happening on
the public-ppl@w3.org mailing list.

FOPRunXSLTExt is written in Java and uses the Apache FOP XSL formatter
to produce the area trees

Prerequisites:

1. Java runtime

2. Saxon 9.4 (or later) HE jar

3. FOP 1.0 XSL formatter.


Windows:

1. Get and install Java JRE

2. Get and install Saxon

   Saxon-HE is available from http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ as a
   Zip-encoded archive.  Download the Zip file and extract its
   contents onto your local disk.

3. Get and install FOP 1.0

   FOP distributions are available from
   http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/download.html.  Download the
   binary distribution of FOP 1.0 and extract its contents onto your
   local disk.

4. Edit 'runsaxon9he_fop10.bat' so the line beginning "set SAXON=" has
   the correct path to the Saxon-HE jar file on your system and so the
   line beginning "set FOP_HOME=" has the correct path to the
   "fop-1.0" folder that you extracted from the FOP binary
   distribution.

5. In the same directory as 'runsaxon9he_fop10.bat', run the following
   command:

      runsaxon9he_fop10.bat example1.xml example1_saxon9_fop10.xsl out/example1_saxon9_fop10.if out example1_saxon9_fop10.if


Linux/Unix:

1. This extension is designed to be compiled against FOP 1.0.

2. Because of the code the saxon9he.jar must be included always; if compiling for Xalan make sure that the Xalan JARs
are first in order, other way around for Saxon. The errors will alert you when you run the extension.

3. Examples - example XSLT stylesheets and shell scripts are provided for the two
possibilities above.

./runsaxon9he_fop10.sh example1.xml example1_saxon9_fop10.xsl out/example1_saxon9_fop10.url out example1_saxon9_fop10.if

./runxalan_fop10.sh example1.xml example1_xalan_fop10.xsl out/example1_xalan_fop10.url out example1_xalan_fop10.if
